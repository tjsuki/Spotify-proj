# Spotify-proj

Load saved Spotify tracks from my account and info associated with each track by utilizing the Spotify API. Data visualization techniques were used
to observe trends and tendencies for the songs I have enjoyed.

Further steps I plan to take will be to learn and apply machine learning techniques to improve my "Discovery Playlist", a playlist generated by Spotify based mon songs
I have been listened to and enjoyed. I would like to improve it by further filtering out songs that I won't enjoy and to autommate this process.
